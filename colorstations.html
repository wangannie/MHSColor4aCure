							<h3 class ="honortitle">Blue Station: Maya Collins</h3>
							<p>Maya was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in 2011 when she was 7 years old.  She had her first bone marrow transplant in September of 2011 and went into remission.  In May of 2012 she relapsed and needed a second transplant.  Both of these required 6 months stays in Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.  All was then wonderful for 4 years until June of 2016 when she learned that her cancer had once again come back.  In August of 2016 Maya and her mom traveled to St. Jude, in Memphis, so Maya could receive a third transplant as part of a clinical trial.  Unfortunately, Maya never fully recovered, and on October 3, 2017 Maya passed away due to complications from her treatment.  Maya was the strongest, bravest girl there is; her fight was inspirational.

							<h3 class ="honortitle">Green Station: Joel Brown</h3>
							<p>Joel was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) on June 11, 2008. Joel spent one month in Cincinnati Children's hospital the summer of 2008, followed by another 7 months of intense treatment.  On October 25, 2010, Joel's spinal tap test results showed that the cancer was back; he had a CNS relapse.  In December 2010 it was determined that Joel would be best treated with a bone marrow transplant. His sister Allison was a perfect match as a donor.  On February 1, 2011, after a week of total body irradiation and chemo to kill off Joel's bone marrow, Allison's cells were harvested, processed and infused into Joel.  In September 2011, Joel was able to go  back to school and lead a normal life.  Joel went on to college at Bowling Green University where he studied to become a nurse.  Joel began working at Jewish Hospital, in their BMT unit, this past summer and just got engaged to his college sweetheart.							</p>

She went through 26 months of treatment which included both oral and intravenous chemotherapy, monthly spinal taps, blood & platelet transfusions and numerous hospital stays.  Hannah went into remission shortly after her treatment began and has remained in remission ever since.  In August of 2017 she started college at the University of Cincinnati and is a Fine Arts Major in the DAAP program.</p>

							<h3 class ="honortitle">Yellow Station: Liz Lothrop</h3>
							<p>Lizzy was diagnosed Oct. 25, 2008, at age 14, with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). It was a long three year battle with chemo, radiation and many hospital stays. She then had two years of regaining her strength before she went off to college in the fall of 2013. June 15, 2015, Liz’s world came crashing down for the second time with cancer - a Glioblastoma Multiform Grade 4 brain tumor.  Liz’s Doctors were not giving her any hope. Elizabeth endured more pain and heartache with this cancer. She had radiation and chemo again, but to no avail. The GMB was vicious and kept returning with a vengeance. Eleven months after Liz was diagnosed she passed on May 3, 2016, in Durham, North Carolina.  Liz’s grace and courage during her final days was inspirational.
